After you enter the crypt, the door slams shut, and you are presented
with an eerie situation. The sunlight that is available is not very
strong but it presents you with a few options. There is a room to the
left, one in front of you, and one to your right. In the room to the
left, you hear some noises. In the room to the right, you hear nothing.
The room presented in front of you has a door that is closed.
