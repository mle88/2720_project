After you walk out of the tavern, you emerge to encounter a bustling
bazaar with people walking to and fro. You admire the success that
the local merchants are having and decide to head over to your
preferred shopkeep to stock up for the travel ahead. Unfortunately,
someone else has other ideas for how your day is going to go. This
unkept individual is entirely up to no good. He approaches you and
you get a feeling that he is looking to cause trouble.

“Hey! You There! That’s a real nice rucksack you’ve got there. I
think it would look better on me. How about you just hand it over and
we go on our way…”
