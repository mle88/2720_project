As you enter the forest you receive a nostalgic feeling of when you
were just an innocent boy exploring the woods with your father. The
trees conveniently present you with two options and a proverbial
fork in the road. To the left you notice the general bustle of the
forest and are intrigued by what you might encounter. To the right,
it is a bit more silent and you can see a clearing in the distance.
In front of you, the path continues. The straight path seems to be
the obvious choice.
