A classic tavern is where you find yourself to begin your afternoon.
After grabbing your first pint and finding a secluded stool to sit
upon at the bar, you canâ€™t help but overhear what people are
chatting about around you. One pair of friends are discussing the
new orange-skinned King of the dominion to the south. A couple are
on an awkward date and endlessly discussing the weather. While all
you really want to do is be alone in your thoughts and drink the
heavenly brew, an old dishevelled man approaches you and without
your permission, sits beside you, orders a round for the two of you
and just starts discussing what is on his mind.
